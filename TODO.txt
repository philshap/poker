- possibly normalize use of arrays vs Collections
- add more tests

x add javadoc
x rename CardRank to FaceValue to avoid confusion with HandRank
x Fix score; value is broken because of the way high card values are stored. E.g. consider (A, A, 2, 3, 4). This will
  score lower than (K, K, 10, J, K). This can be fixed by splitting the score into two values; the rank computed
  score and the face value score, which doesn't include any of the rank cards.
x create wrapper class Ranking to encapsulate hand score, description and rank
x generate hand description string in HandRank.match()
x avoid redundant work in HandRank.compareSameHand() by generating hand score in HandRank.match()
x Hand.matchSuit() only needs a single loop
x HandRank.STRAIGHT_FLUSH.compareSameHand() needs to compare rank, not card
x instead of:
    hand.highCard().cardRank.compareTo(otherHand.highCard().cardRank)
  could use:
    Hand.compareHighCards(hand, otherHand);
x can inline HandRank.matchOfAKind()
