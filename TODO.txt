- modify combine util to create arrays directly instead of lists
- possibly unwrap lambda in Dealer.findBestHand to avoid array for state

x Hand.matchSuit() only needs a single loop
x HandRank.STRAIGHT_FLUSH.compareSameHand() needs to compare rank, not card
x instead of:
    hand.highCard().cardRank.compareTo(otherHand.highCard().cardRank)
  could use:
    Hand.compareHighCards(hand, otherHand);
x can inline HandRank.matchOfAKind()
